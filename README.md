# JavaScript Mini Projects

This repository contains a collection of mini projects aimed at practicing JavaScript, Node.js, and working with third-party APIs. Each project focuses on different aspects of JavaScript, including event handling, DOM manipulation, and working with APIs.


## Random Movie by Category

The first project is a "Random Movie by Category" application. This project uses the Movie DB API to fetch random movies based on their categories. Users can select a category, and the application will display a random movie from that category. This project is designed to practice working with APIs and event handling in JavaScript.
